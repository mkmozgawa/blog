I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer dabbling with security and computer vision. Currently working at [Netguru](https://netguru.com/). I also play with the [Sealcode CTF team](https://ctftime.org/team/111943).

I ❤︎ learning new things and sharing my knowledge with others, hence this blog. (It also serves as a reference sheet for me.)

If you have any questions the easiest way to contact me would be via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%F0%9F%8C%8D-magda-m-b6b925189/).
