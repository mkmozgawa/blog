Yesterday I moved this site from Pelican and Github Pages to Gatsby and Netlify, using [this starter](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen). It still requires some restyling to give it a more personal feeling, but I'm overall happy with how it works. And yes, it makes an insane number of requests; but it's a PWA, so it's hip, stylish & fun. Deal with it ðŸ˜Ž
